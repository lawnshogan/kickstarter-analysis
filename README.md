# Kickstarter Analysis - Deliverable 3
###  **Project Overview**
- Louise needs help with an analysis of tabular data she has compiled of Kickstarter Campaigns around the globe. The compiled spreadsheet contains information regarding dates, funding goals, pledged funding, outcomes, type of campaign, etc.
- ### Kickstarter Campaign data and its purpose:
    1. Why are we analyzing this data?
    2. What is the goal and possible outcomes?
    3. What pieces of data can help build toward and obtain our goal(s)?
- Louise estimates she'll need around $12,000 for her campaign but needs help determining if this is a reasonable estimate.



### **Analysis**
So I have all this data and created a goal to help Louise calculate how much money she will need to raise. 

I open up the spreadsheet and realize there needs to be some formatting and filtering that needs to occur to fully comprehend the spreadsheet.

As I got a feel for the data, questions started becoming clear:
- What country should the analysis be based on?
- What category/subcategory should we focus on?
- How often did successful (or failed) campaigns reach their goal?
- What time of the year are the majority of successful/failed campaigns launched?

With these questions in mind, we can begin filtering our data and set parameters that allow us to draw conclusions. **[Pivot Tables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576)** are a great way of setting parameters and summarizing data in an efficient manner. In addition to this, **[Pivot Charts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivotchart-c1b1e057-6990-4c38-b52b-8255538e7b1c)** are a great way of visualizing pivot tables, which is important in finding patterns.

I was able to use these tools in my analysis to filter by country & category/subcategory to summarize and visualize the number of failed, canceled and successful.
